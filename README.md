# MGFO - A Python Library for Microgrids Analisys and Optimization

MGFO combines the expressiveness of Python and the power of these nice projects:

  - Pyomo
  - Pandas
  - PandaPower
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Many others...

To create an open source tool for the analysis and optimization of electrical grids. Special emphasis is in the study of renewable (solar, wind, etc.) resources insertion.

To use MGFO simple download or clone in your machine this repository and load the notebook samples. You need to install the following libraries:

  - Pyomo
  - Pandas
  - PandaPower
  - MathPlotLib (to graph results)

Adn must install some optimization solver supported by Pyomo. MGFO was tested with CPLEX and GLPK. Also, you can use the NEOS Optimization Server (https://neos-server.org/neos/) direcly from your notebook.

Enjoy!
